"""Webhook event types emitted by Open Wearables.

Each value follows the Svix convention: ``<resource>.<action>``.
Keep in sync with the init script that registers them with the Svix server.

All events use the ``created`` action — there is no update/patch flow.

**Two-level hierarchy:**
- *Group events* (e.g. ``heart_rate.created``) fire for any sample belonging to
  that category.  Subscribe here if you want all data of a given kind.
- *Granular events* (``series.<series_type>.created``) fire for a single
  SeriesType slug.  Subscribe here if you need only a specific metric.

Both events are emitted for every ingestion batch — consumers can subscribe to
either level or both.  ``EVENT_TYPE_GROUPS`` provides the full group → granular
mapping for UI renderers and documentation generators.
